Import links in the BibTeX reference format.

== Description ==

Import entries from the BibTeX reference format as a custom post type 'Publication', either from a file
or URL. Only valid entries (with title and URL, no duplicate) are imported, errors will be reported during importing. The importer will automatically link authors to posts adding new authors as terms with the taxonomy
'authors' if necessary.

The plugin relies on a custom post type 'Publication' being present with at least the fields described in the
fields_for_type() function. It also has a dependancy on the advanced-custom-fields plugin.

The importer uses the bibtexParse library from the Bibliophile project: http://bibliophile.sourceforge.net/ and was originally based on the BibTeX Importer: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/.
